### How It Works

- Go to the app's home page at https://mynytscraper.herokuapp.com/.
- Users are able to query the New York Times based on topic and date. It displays the results in a rendered list with the article title, publication date, id, and allows the user to visit an article's url or save the article to the MongoDB.
- When users hit the "Saved" button, it renders articles that are saved in the MongoDB and allows the user to visit the article's url or delete it from the MongoDB.
